# Pokedex

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Create a Pokédex that will allow the user to see a list of Pokémons and save its favorites on a separate list.

The application must provide:
- List of Pokémons on the main page
    - Capable of filtering by name
- List of favorite Pokémons
    - The API can be mocked on the browser’s local storage
- Code commits either by providing the .git folder or a public repo
- Automated tests are a good addition but they are not mandatory

The API that should be used to get the data is https://pokeapi.co/. We provide the request functions at `src/services` but feel free to modify them as you need.

Suggested designs (the design does not need to be perfect, it only illustrates the idea):
